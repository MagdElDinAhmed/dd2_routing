test 1:
25x25 grid
No additional penalties for using vias or going against the preferred path
No obstacles
3 nets, each having 2 pins, and all pins are on layer 0

test 2;
25x25 grid
No additional penalties for using vias or going against the preferred path
Obstacles are present on the direct path between the pins
3 nets, each having 2 pins, and the 2 pins are either on the same x value or the same y value
1 of the nets has both pins on the same layer
2 nets have the pins on different layers

test 3:
25x50 grid
Penalty for using a via is 5
Penalty for going against the preferred path is 3
Obstacles are present. Some are expensive enough to make using a via more effective for one net. Others make the router choose to go against the preferred path for another.
2 nets, each having 2 pins, and the pins of each net are on the same metal layer

test 4:
25x50 grid
Penalty for using a via is 5
Penalty for going against the preferred path is 3
No obstacles. The wires of one net will become the obstacles for another
2 nets, each having 2 pins, and the pins are on the same metal layer

test 5:
50x25 grid
No additional penalties for using vias or going against the preferred path
No obstacles
1 net with 4 pins, 2 of the pins are on one layer and the other 2 are on the other
